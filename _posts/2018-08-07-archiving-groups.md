<p>When students move away or switch classes, it is possible to hide them from the members management list but still retain their information and path progress by archiving a group that they are a member of. This will only work if they are in a single group.</p>
<h2>Archiving a Group</h2>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the group’s manage page by clicking on the group’s title on the “Groups” page if it is in either the “My Groups” or “Other Groups” sections. If the group is in the “Pending Groups” section of the page, assign yourself to the group as a follower by clicking on “Assign Coaches.” The group will move to the “My Groups” section. </li>
<li>On the group’s manage page, click “Archive.”</li>
<li>The word “Archive” will appear in front of the group’s title, and the system will confirm that the group has been archived with the message, “This group has been archived.”</li>
</ol>

<p></p>
<p>At this point the group will be hidden from the list of groups on the Group Management page, and will not show up in your filters on the Metrics page.</p>
<h2>Viewing archived groups on the Groups Page</h2>
<ol>
<li>On the Groups Page, click on “Archived Groups.”</li>
<li>A list of archived groups will appear on the page.</li>
<li>Click “Archived Groups” again to hide this list.</li>
</ol>

<p></p>
<ol>
<li>On the Metrics page, click on the group filter menu and then select “Show Archived.”</li>
<li>Any groups that have been archived will be displayed in the menu.</li>
<li>When you’re done, you can also hide the archived groups by clicking on “Hide Archived.”</li>
</ol>
