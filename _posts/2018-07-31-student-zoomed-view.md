<p>When reviewing a student’s responses, access their path progress by clicking on their name in the metrics page. This view keeps focused on individual student work and support.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Once the zoomed view for a specific student opens, view a record of their interaction with each activity.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The page will show a list of the activities that the student has completed. Click on the plus icon next to an activity’s name to expand out its list of steps. Or, an activity will display with its list of steps expanded if there are any comments that are waiting for a reply.</p>

<p>From this page, you can use the comment field to post a response to the students’ path comments. You can also cheer a student’s answer by clicking on the thumbs up icon.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As you are reviewing students’ path responses, you can use the left/right arrows on the right hand side of the page’s header to advance forward or backwards through the list of students. </p>

<p>View all Replies</p>
<p></p>
<p>A link “View all replies” also allows you to view a compilation of students’ responses. Use this option for skills based online coaching for harder hitting questions.</p>
