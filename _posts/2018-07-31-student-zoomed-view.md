<p>When you want to review a student’s responses, you can access their path progress by clicking on their name in the metrics page.</p>

<p>Once you are in the zoomed view for a specific student, you can view a record of their interaction with each activity.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The page will show a list of the activities that the student has completed. Click on the plus icon next to an activity’s name to expand out its list of steps. Or, an activity will display with its list of steps expanded if there are any comments that are waiting for a reply.</p>
