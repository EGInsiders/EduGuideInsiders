<p>EduGuide is excited to be able to partner with you and your students on completion of activities in the path. Email is a tool that we often use to help encourage members to continue in the path system. Typically, email notifications are sent for the following purposes:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Team Launch or Relaunch</li>
<li>Team invitations (Coaches only)</li>
<li>IT Test Requests</li>
<li>Alerts of new path activities</li>
<li>Path reminders</li>
<li>Cheers</li>
<li>Messages and comments posted on team boards</li>
<li>Goal reminders</li>
<li>Goals assigned to members</li>
<li>Resetting passwords</li>
<li>Daily and weekly path progress reports (Coaches only)</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>We recommend that you ensure that your team members receive EduGuide’s emails by adding our email addresses to your white list.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Request that EduGuide’s domain name be added to your organization’s white list</h2>
<p></p>
<p>As a beginning step, it would be helpful to talk to your IT support staff about adding EduGuide’s domain, “eduguide.org,” to your organization’s email white list. This would allow emails from our website and staff to reach team coaches.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You can also white list emails from EduGuide by taking the following steps inside your personal email account.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Google Email</h3>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>Open the email.</li>
<li>Click on the drop down arrow next to the “Reply” button.</li>

<li>Select “Filter messages like these”</li>
<li>At the bottom of the search window, click “Create filter with this search”</li>
</ol>
<p></p>

</ol>
