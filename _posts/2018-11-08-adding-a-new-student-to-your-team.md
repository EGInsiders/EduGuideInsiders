<p>If you need to add a new student to your team, you can instruct them to complete the same process your class completed when it initially joined the team.</p>
<p>The student will need to have the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Email Address</li>
<li>Password</li>
</ul>
<p>Ask them to to navigate to http://join.eduguide.org. They will be asked if they already have an account, or if they need to create a new one. If this is their first time on the site, ask them to create a new one.</p>

<p>The registration page will prompt the student to enter in their email address, password, and the join code for your group.</p>
<p>Once they submit their information, they will be added to both your team, and to your group. They will be able to immediately begin working on their path.</p>
