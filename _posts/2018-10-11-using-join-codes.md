Join codes can come in different forms. Typically, they are displayed as:
<ul>
 	<li>Group Join Codes</li>
 	<li>Invitation Links</li>
</ul>
<h2>Group Join Codes</h2>
Group join codes are associated with a specific group in the team, and can be located inside the group management page by clicking on “Invite Members.”
<h2>Invitation Links</h2>
Invitation links are automatically generated when a team invitation is generated. This is typically done from the team setup page within a team.
<h2>Join codes and the registration process</h2>
Typically, visitors on the site can only join if they have been provided with a join code or sent a team invitation via email. Either method will allow them to register on the site, and join a team. In the case of members using the join code, they will also be added to a group that is associated with that join code. Coaches are not set as members of a group when they join, but if they are a lead coach, a group is created for them and then they are made a follower of that group.
<h2>Path Subscriptions</h2>
In the case of core learning teams, new members of the site are also subscribed to a path if the path subscription has been enabled for their team. The user’s role on the site determines which version of the path they are shown. For example, if they are a coach, they will be subscribed to the professional development version of the path. If they are a student, they will be assigned to the student version of the path.
