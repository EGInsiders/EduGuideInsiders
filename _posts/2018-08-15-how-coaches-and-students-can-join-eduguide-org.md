<h1>Joining EduGuide</h1>
This document describes the differences and similarities for the join process for Team Coaches and their students.
<h2>Coaches Joining EduGuide</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Only Admin Coaches and Team Captains can use the Invite Coaches tool in the Setup option in the Main Menu to invite other Team Coaches by using their email address.</li>
 	<li>Once Team Coachesâ€™ emails have been entered and an invitation email is sent by Admin Coaches or Team Captains using the Setup Tool, other Team Coaches can then access the team.</li>
 	<li>Each Team Coach will receive automatic reminders to join the team until done.</li>
 	<li>Using the Invite Coaches tool gives Team Coaches full access to the platform.</li>
 	<li>Do not use the Invite Coaches Tool for students since they should join as Team Members with restricted access. This keeps accounts private from students on the team.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Students join the team with a 7-digit invitation code.</h2>
The 7-digit invitation code is generated when each group is created.
<h3>Go to the Main Menu and click on Groups, and the Group Management Page will appear.</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>If the Auto Groups feature is ON, then each Lead Coach has one group automatically created for them as they join the team.
This gives each Lead Group one group with a specific 7-digit invitation code for students who are working with them to use in order to join the team and that particular group.</li>
 	<li>If the Auto Group feature is OFF, then Admin Coaches and Team Captains can create groups as needed (by grade, teacher, class, etc.) in order to generate the 7-digit invitation code for students to join the team through that specific group.</li>
 	<li>Click Create to make a group. Click the Invite button to the left of each group name to access the unique 7-digit Invitation Code for students to join the team in this group.
<ul>
 	<li>In-Person Join Directions Given</li>
 	<li>Online Join Hyperlink Shared Electronically</li>
 	<li>View List to Select Students for Additional Groups After Joining Team</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
