<p><i>This is the message that we send to IT professionals when a coach is asking for an IT test of their team. The IT Testing consists of checking the configuration of their network, and then running through a brief version of the path. The purpose of the revisions was to share more details about the testing with the IT Tester in the email, so it is explained sooner and perhaps allows them to begin working on the changes before they join the site. Placeholders inside “<<>>” symbols indicate data that will be plugged into the notifications when they are generated.</i></p>

<p>Hi, there. <<Coach Name>> has asked for your help on a quick IT Test to remove any firewall or other issues for <<Team Name>> to work with the nonprofit EduGuide.

You will get the most accurate results during the testing if you complete the process on a typical student computer and inside your building’s network environment. The IT Testing wizard will walk you through the process step-by-step of whitelisting EduGuide’s email addresses and approving its site for access through your network.<<Coach Name>> will be notified when your process is complete. IT Testing should be completed for each school which will be starting a team on EduGuide.org.

P.S. If you will also be a coach working with students or accessing reports on EduGuide, it’s important that you use a different email address for your IT Testing account.
