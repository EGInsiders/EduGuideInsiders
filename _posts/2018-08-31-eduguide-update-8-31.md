As Summer winds down, EduGuide is in the midst of pushing out a series of big changes to its website in preparation of the start to the school year for many of its partners.

This week, we rolled out a major update to our path system which introduced some structural changes and cosmetic improvements. I am looking for a few volunteers who are available to run through the path on the live site either as a coach or student, and then share feedback. More information and instructions can be found in the Google document below:

This week, we are testing new functionality which will allow us to set up conditional sub steps based on students' responses to our poll steps. I am also looking for help with testing this feature on our staging site. More information can be found in the following Google Document:

I will also be releasing new knowledgebase articles for review by editors. More information will be posted in Slack and Podio as they become available.

If you would like to participate in either of the beta tests, or if you have questions, feel free to contact me in Slack or via email at <a href="mailto:jon@eduguide.org">jon@eduguide.org</a>.

Thanks,
