<p><b>Q:</b></p>
<h2>Does EduGuide accommodate hearing or vision impaired students?</h2>
<p><b>A:</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>EduGuide is compatible with a variety of audio readers. We do not have a built-in reader for students, but you can integrate other audio tools with our platform. There are also a variety of resources available in the Team Library to provide differentiated instruction for learners who may need accommodations with the online activities. </p>
<p></p>
<p>The Core Learning Path - Guided Discussion document provides a breakdown of all available activities for students. This can be used to support their work in the activities. In addition, we suggest that each teacher creates a class account that they can use to provide ways in which students can take learning offline into whole class or group work.
