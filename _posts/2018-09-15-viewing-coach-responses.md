Typically, students will post a response to a question in the path and then coaches will respond to the student as they review their progress in the Metrics page. Students are shown pending coach responses in screens that appear after they log in for a new session and before they resume their work on the path.
<h2>Viewing a coach’s comment in a response screen</h2>
<ol>
 	<li>Log into your account</li>
 	<li>After you log in, a screen will appear stating that you have received a response from a coach</li>
 	<li>Read the comment and respond in the same way that you would in the path</li>
 	<li>When you are done, you will be either taken to another response screen, or your path will launch</li>
</ol>

It is possible to skip a response screen by clicking on the arrow located at the upper right hand side of the page. Keep in mind that you will not be able to access that response screen again.

You can also respond to coaches’ responses via the Path Journal and your path. You would do this by navigating to the path journal and then jumping back into the activity where the comment was posted.
<ol>
 	<li>Click on the main menu, and then click on “Path Journal.”</li>
 	<li>In the Path Journal, click on a module title, and then click on the title of the activity you would like to review</li>
 	<li>Click on the words “Go” next to the step that you would like to view</li>
 	<li>From inside that step, or a step you page to, respond to your coach’s comment</li>
</ol>
