<h2>As a user, I would like to be able to download data from metrics</h2>
<p>As a coach, I would like to be able to download the data represented by a view in Metrics. The data would download as a xls formatted as a xls or csv file for easy viewing in a spreadsheet program.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When I view a page of data in the metrics, a link labeled “Download as csv” would display along the top of the page. The file would download.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The option of downloading a file as a csv would appear for the following views:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Activities</li>
<li>Coaching Recieved</li>
<li>Coaching Given</li>
<li>PD Activities</li>
<li>Time Invested</li>
<li>Coaches Joined</li>
<li>Coaches Oriented</li>
<li>Coaches Following Groups</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Coaches would be able to download the data on-demand.</p>
