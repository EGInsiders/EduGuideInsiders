<p>This is a mock up of the notification which is sent out to coaches when a comment in EduGuideâ€™s path system is identified as requiring further action. The purpose of the email is to identify the student who posted the comment, the content of their comment, and then prompt the coach to take action. They can view the posted comment within the site, or they can dismiss the warning based on their judgement of what the situation is with the student.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Feel free to contact me or post comments if you have any questions.</p>

<p>Does this comment look safe? Crisis Catcher is an extra layer of protection to identify people you know who may need help. But to err on the side of safety, it sometimes catches warning words in normal writing. If this comment looks harmless, we're sorry for disturbing you, please dismiss it to turn the warning off and help us identify ways to improve our monitoring systems.</p>
<p>Unsafe? Please follow the steps for your group to help people in crisis. You could also collaborate with other people from your team who follow this person and have received this warning: <u>Bruce Wayne</u>, <u>Hal Gordan</u>, <u>Wally West</u>, <u>Diane Prince</u>, <u>Dick Ward</u>.</p>
