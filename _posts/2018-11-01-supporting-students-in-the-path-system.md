The activities in EduGuide’s path system are designed to guide students on weekly journey through self-reflection and deep thinking. Each week’s activity uses a combination of dialogue, media, and discussion questions to explore a specific topic. The discussion questions spark thought in students as they apply what they’ve learned in a given lesson to their own life or past experiences.

Coaches help students by responding to what they wrote, encouraging them to expand on an idea or asking follow up questions. This also helps the coaches to understand the students a little better.

Activities also talk to students about the value of mentoring and especially mentoring their peers. They practice mentoring a younger version of themselves which the path content tends to refer to as “Quinn.” By practicing how they might use what they’ve learned to help others, the path is planting the seeds for a culture shift in the students’ school or organization.

Along the way, if students express feelings indicating a problem with low self-esteem, bullying, thoughts of suicide, or self harm, coaches are able to intervene via the comments or by connecting the student with outside sources.

EduGuide’s Crisis Catcher feature will also screen for key words or phrases which have a high probability of indicating that a student is experiencing an issue. When such a comment is detected, coaches on the students’ team are notified so that they can take the appropriate actions.
