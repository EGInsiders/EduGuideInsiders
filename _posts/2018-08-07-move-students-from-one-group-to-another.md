<p>It is easy to change the group that a student belongs to. This is an easy process that can be completed from either Under the 'Edit Membership' option in the Membership Management area on the Metrics Page, or by clicking on the 'Groups' and 'Members' pages under the main menu.</p>
<h2>Member Management</h2>
<p>From your team’s Member Management page, click on the button labeled “Add to Group” located to the left of the student’s name. A list of groups will appear, along with the groups that the student currently belongs. The groups that the student belongs to will appear with a checkmark next to its name. Change the student’s group membership by unchecking the group. This  removes them from that group,  then click to add a checkmark next to the group where they  will be added to.</p>

<p>You can also adjust a student’s group membership from their Edit Membership page. This page can be found under the ‘Metrics’ or ‘Members’ pages. To access this page, click on the option menu located to the far right side of the student’s name, and then click on “Edit Membership.”</p>

<p>The membership information for that student will appear. Click on the button labeled “Belongs to Groups” under the header “Groups.”  A list of available groups will appear.
