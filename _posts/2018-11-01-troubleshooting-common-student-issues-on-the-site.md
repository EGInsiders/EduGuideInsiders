The process students follow when they join the site is designed to be as smooth as possible; however, there are times when things happen that are unexpected. This article will describe what the student experience should be, some of the common issues and causes that we have noticed during the last year, and possible solutions.
<h2>Student Join Process</h2>
When students join their team, they should be ready to enter the following information:
<ol>
 	<li>Name</li>
 	<li>Email Address</li>
 	<li>Password</li>
 	<li>Group Join Code</li>
</ol>
Their email address will serve as their user ID when they log in for subsequent sessions, and it will be the address where notifications are sent to as they progress through the path, or use other functions such as the password reset page. The group join code serves the purpose of granting them permission to create an account on the site, and associates them with a specific team and group.
<h3>Registering for an account</h3>
When a student registers on the site, they will need to go to http://join.eduguide.org. It is important that they enter this specific URL into their browser or click a link referencing this address. The first screen they will see asks them if they would like to log in or create a new account. New students will want to create an account, but returning students will want to log in.
<h3>Entering the Join Code</h3>
There is a field on both the registration and the login pages where students can enter the join code for their coach’s group. On the login screen, students will need to click the link “Have a code?” in order to reveal the field. Once they have completed the form, they can continue by submitting their information.
<h3>Customizing Avatar and Starting Path</h3>
Upon joining the site, students will be prompted to customize their avatar, then taken to the first activity in the path. While students are members of the team, much like coaches are, they are not shown the team pages or presented with the same team member experience. Instead, they can only access their path and related pages, personal dashboard, and account settings.
<h2>Returning to the site</h2>
Students do not need to enter in the join code each time they log into the site, and in fact, do not need the code once they have an account. Instead, students with existing accounts can login either from the homepage or the address http://login.eduguide.org.

When students log into the site, their path will resume on the activity that they last left off on.
<h2>Common Student Account or Team-Related issues</h2>
As there are a number of steps which students need to complete before they are able to access their paths, there are sometimes issues which come up. The following is a description of a few of the common issues and some solutions to try.
<h3>Student cannot log into their account</h3>
<h4>Description:</h4>
Student tries to log in but is told that their password or username is invalid.
<h4>Solution:</h4>
<ol>
 	<li>Confirm that they are entering in their email address and their password correctly. If they are, confirm that they are using the same spelling they used when they originally registered on the site. Sometimes students introduce typos into their email addresses, which can be missed initially. If there is a variation, they should enter in their email address exactly the same way that they entered it when they registered, then change it in their personal settings page.</li>
 	<li>Change the student’s password and/or email address in the Member Management page within your team.</li>
 	<li>If the student suspects that their password is wrong, suggest that they request a password reset. There is a link that they can click in order to request the reset.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Student is on the site, but they are not on the team</h3>
<h4>Description:</h4>
Student has logged on but has been taken to their personal dashboard instead of the path. When they open up the main menu, the link for their path is not visible.
<h4>Solution:</h4>
<ol>
 	<li>Ask them to log out and then log back in again. Instruct them to enter your group join code as they are logging in. This should add them to your group and activate their path subscription.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Student is shown a “Path subscription invalid” message</h3>
<h4><img title="" src="http://cyberland.gazerbeam.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/null-25.png" alt="" width="624" height="292" /></h4>
<h4>Description:</h4>
If the student is shown a message saying that their path subscription is invalid or expired, this could be an indication that their subscription has not yet been enabled.
<h4>Solution</h4>
<ol>
 	<li>Have students click on the link on the page. They will be taken to another page where they can enter in your group’s join code.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Student is not the member of a group</h3>
Description:

A student is not listed when you filter for a group on Metrics, or view the list of group members in the group management page.

Solution
<ol>
 	<li>Double check your group filters to confirm that you have selected the correct group.</li>
 	<li>Search for the student in the Member Management page and then add them to a group.</li>
</ol>
