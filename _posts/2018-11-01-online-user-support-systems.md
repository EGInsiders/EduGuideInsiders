<h1>Online User Support System Plan</h1>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The Online User Support System consists of all of the elements on the website which ensure a smooth and positive experience for members as they use the EduGuide.org website. These include the website interface, instructions or helper text, online user resources such as tutorials and knowledgebase articles, and channels for communication such as email and live chat.</p>
<p>The goal of this document is to define these elements, and to describe how they will work together to assist the user.</p>
<h1>Analysis & Criteria</h1>
<h1>User Support Layers</h1>
<p>The user support process is viewed as a layer of interactions designed to improve members’ experiences on the site. These layers are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Intuitive Design</b> - The user interface should be easy to understand and self-explanatory. Concepts on the site should conform with established standards or norms from across the Internet. Uses of symbols and terminology should also be consistent across the site.</li>
<li><b>Help Text</b> - Additional instructions are displayed temporarily as users get started on the site with tooltips which are made available in critical junctures across the site. These elements can be added to help reinforce important concepts that users are forgetting or getting stuck on.</li>
<li><b>Inline User Orientation</b> - We will want to build in an automated user orientation which helps users understand the interface of the site and prompts them to complete specific steps as they are getting started on the site.</li>
<li><b>Knowledgebase/User Resources</b> - We will be implementing a knowledgebase as a part of the user support system to boost members’ understanding of the site. This would be the last layer where they could turn to before reaching out to human-based help.</li>
<li><b>Live Chat </b>- We will continue to offer live chat to users as a feature. Users are more casual about their questions/issues when communicating in real time online with a person, than when they are filing a trouble ticket. Live chat has proven to be a slightly more positive experience for both sides.</li>
<li><b>Trouble Tickets/Email </b>- The final electronic layer is a means for reporting and resolving larger issues. It can serve as an alternative to the live chat.</li>
<li><b>Phone/Voice Support </b>- Some issues are too complex to address electronically with partners, and live chat may not be practical in all circumstances. Therefore, it may be necessary to reach out via the phone, Google Hangouts, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2>User Support Philosophy</h2>
<p>The main goal for the support system is that it should be so integrated into the website to the point where the user does not think of it as support. This will ensure the users’ experience on the site remains positive. Therefore, user support begins in the earliest stages of web development where we will want to conduct research into our users. We would want to achieve the following through our research, web development, and implementation of user support resources:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Understand our users</b> - When we understand how our members will think, we can build systems that conform to their needs and expectations.</li>
<li><b>Understand where our users fail</b> - No system is perfect, so once there is a problem it will be important to understand where and why it exists. There may even be points in the design of the site which slow users down, but they do not think of or report as problems. It will be important to detect these areas in advance. This can also be determined through a study of our online resources. The more popular or responded to article or video tutorial might indicate a topic that requires additional explanation or support within the site.</li>
<li><b>Understand where our users succeed</b> - This includes the moments when users follow directions exactly, and when they find new ways to apply our website features. If we can identify these “tricks,” we can pass them along to other members or it might give us insight into our users’ thinking.</li>
<li><b>Understand the best way to relay information about our website to our users</b> - Articles, FAQs, and videos seem like a sure bet for our users, but we will be studying our audience to understand what they prefer the most. At the least, the process for finding a solution, whether it is via the knowledgebase, chat, or email should be very smooth and natural.</li>
</ul>
<p>The most critical strategy for our user support efforts is to maintain a continuous conversation with our members--especially the coaches--to catch opportunities to learn more, and so our users feel comfortable with approaching us about their difficulties. In the past, we have relied a lot on ticket tracking to capture and resolve our members’ issues, while this has its efficiencies, this could be stifling dialogue with users. The words “ticket” or “case” tends to indicate a reported problem. We want users to reach out to the help desk before their poor experiences are bad enough to be labeled as problematic.</p>
<h3>Target Audience</h3>
<p>Our membership can be separated into four main groups: Teachers/School Administrators, students, professionals, and EduGuide Admins. Each group needs nuanced levels of support, and their needs should to be taken into account as we develop the website and as we create an effective user support system.</p>
<h4>Teachers/School Administrators</h4>
<p>Typically, teachers and school administrators will join as coaches, and take on the responsibility of launching their team, adding students, monitoring path progress, responding to students’ path comments, and completing the path at a professional development level. Within the designation of coach, there are several roles which are assigned differing levels of capabilities. Typically, Admin Coaches are expected to “take charge” by launching and configuring the team. The Team Captain, champions the program, maintains communication with the EduGuide Results Coach, and oversees the entire staff of coaches. Lead and support coaches have a reduced level of access with the former working more directly with the students and the latter predominantly offering solely online support.</p>
<p>From a user experience perspective, these differing coach roles mean the team offers three different user experiences for coaches. An Admin Coach would be able to change the name of a group for example, but a support coach would not have access to this online feature. From a user support perspective, this means we must be very careful about how we describe the roles and responsibilities of the different coach designations, because they not only need to be accurate, but they need to match up with the real world expectations of the members who take on a coach role.</p>
<p>Coaches serve another vital role of ambassadors between the site and the students, which makes it even more vital that they have a strong understanding of the system, and their experience is a positive one.</p>
<h4>Students</h4>
<p>Students pose the biggest challenge on the site because they can be the most unpredictable. Many students are computer savvy, but instruction on the site needs to be very clear because students do not take the time to read. We are also serving a student population which includes a wide range of ages from elementary school to college. There are many sides of the student perspective which we need to serve, so the site needs to be universally easy to use and accessible. Fortunately, the student role limits their access to the site and creates a very specific and narrow experience on the platform.</p>
<p>Our greatest challenge with students is the onboarding process, which has historically been a difficult process for coaches. We have streamlined this process and are continuing to make developments to assist coaches in facilitating the joining of students to the team.</p>
<h4>Professionals</h4>
<p>Professional users are noteworthy mostly because they have access to the site’s full features. Members and coaches both have access to the team pages, can post on the team dashboard, and access the team library. They must rely more on their understanding of the site’s feature and navigation as they use the different tools.</p>

<h1>User Stories</h1>
<h2>As an EduGuide Member, I would like to be able to easily access EduGuide resources or submit my questions via live chat/email</h2>
<p>As the user navigates around the site, a tab would be made available to them which they can open up if they have questions. Within the tab, they can enter in a question or a phrase, and results will show the knowledgebase articles with matching keywords. If they choose, they can also click “Live chat” in order to open up a live chat window. They would be prompted for a question and their contact information. If an EduGuide representative is available for chat, they would be engaged via the chat. If we are not online, then their question would be delivered to our helpdesk as a ticket. A link would also be provided in the main navigation which the user could click if they wanted to view our support site.</p>

<h2>As a Team Coach, I would like to be able to easily access documents which help me with setting up my team and preparing my students for their work in the path</h2>
<p>Currently, team resources are distributed to coaches via the team libraries. One challenge with this is it requires EduGuide staff to upload documents into each library as new teams are created. This creates more work in the future as these documents are updated or discontinued. It would be ideal to be able to send coaches to one central file depository where a single copy of each file can be stored, and then coaches would be able to download the documents they need. A central library also offers EduGuide the ability to quickly update a document, and have it be readily available to all partners. Currently, a change cannot be made without having to update the library for each individual team.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The following documents are included in each team library as a resource for coaches:</p>

<h2>As a user, I would like to resolve my problem or question by chatting live with an EduGuide representative</h2>
<p>Testing has shown it is often easier to resolve a user’s issue live via chat than via email or a ticket. One advantage chat has over email is that it allows the EduGuide staff member (“agent”) to ask questions and get clarification on the issue. Sometimes, users will describe their problem in a way that leads you to believe it concerns X, then as they clarify you realize they really mean Y. Email makes communication and accurate clarification trickier because of the time involved with responding to the original ticket, waiting for a response, asking for more clarification, and so on.</p>
<p>An important factor with supporting teachers, especially, is due to the fact that their students will typically work on their path on EduGuide only once or twice a week. So, if a student encountered the problem on a Monday, and it was reported on Tuesday, there is only six days to either resolve the problem or ask the right questions to bring it closer to resolution. Otherwise the student returns and attempts to complete the path again but unfortunately would encounter the same problem.</p>
<p>Chat also tends to be less formal, and does not carry the stigma that comes with creating a trouble ticket in the helpdesk system. Users will feel more open about submitting their questions via chat because they are not as concerned about it being “important” enough.</p>
<p></p>

<h2>As a member of the site, I would like to be guided through the process of completing specific tasks and understanding the features which are offered on the platform</h2>
<p>Our website should always attempt to answer the following basic question for our users:</p>
<ul>
<li>Now what?</li>
<li>I want to do X, how do I do that?</li>
<li>I am done for now, but I’m not sure when I can/should return to the site</li>
<li>What part(s) of the site require my attention the most?</li>
</ul>
<p>I think one of our weakest points in a member’s account life cycle happens directly after they’ve joined the team.At this point, they are either not sure what to do next, or they have an idea of what they would like to do, but are not ready to complete the next step. Frequently, this is the time when they are looking for something on the site to engage with.</p>
<p>PAGE_BREAK: PageBreak</p>
<p></p>
<h1>Implementation</h1>
<p>The following strategies and tools will be incorporated into our user support system:</p>
<h2>User Research</h2>
<p>We will conduct user research to learn more about how our members are interacting with the site, identify weaknesses, and then implement solutions. User research will focus on existing features, features in development and features in the planning stage.</p>
<p>To help facilitate the research, the following groups will be formed:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Community Support Committee</b> - EduGuide staff members will be selected to be members of a Community Support Committee. This committee will work together to identify key user issues, plan research experiments or campaigns, analyze the results, and then recommend changes. They will also recommend the issues in the backlog which should be addressed next by developers. They will also oversee several user focus groups.</li>
<li><b>Coaches Focus Group</b> - This will be a group of select coaches. We would ask them for feedback on current and upcoming features.</li>
<li><b>Beta Testers</b> - This group will be dedicated to testing the site and identifying potential issues or bugs.</li>
<li><b>IT Focus Group</b> - Group of IT Professionals who are involved in maintaining their schools’ networks. We would ask for some feedback, but this group would be mostly used to announce changes to the systems, or to share tips.</li>
</ul>
<h2></h2>
<h2>PAGE_BREAK: PageBreak</h2>
<h2>User Support Site</h2>
<p>A User support site will be set up where users can access a wide range of mechanisms for support. The information will be integrated into the site via a widget. Users will also be able to navigate to the full support site,where they can create a ticket, post a question, join (create an account), or log into an existing account. Articles covering common topics will be made public, but other sections or articles would only be made accessible to support site members only.</p>
<p>The Support Site will be separated into two main areas: Knowledgebase and Community Forum.</p>
<h3>Knowledgebase</h3>
<p>The knowledgebase will contain articles which follow different structures or formats. These would include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Articles</li>
<li>FAQs</li>
<li>Quick Guides (bullet points or steps)</li>
<li>User Guides (Longer than an article)</li>
<li>Best Practices</li>
<li>Video Tutorials</li>
<li>Glossary</li>
</ul>

<h4></h4>
<h4>PAGE_BREAK: PageBreak</h4>
<h4>Structure</h4>
<p>Each “article” will contain information focussed around a specific concept or function on the site. These smaller articles will be contained under overarching topics. Users might learn about an entire feature by paging through a series of articles, or they might begin to explore a specific function via a keyword search. Similar or associated articles will be listed, so it is easy for the user to continue to learn more if they choose.</p>
<p>A “FAQ” will consist of a series of questions and answers which are associated tightly together. We would serve up one question and answer pair per entry. Best Practices and User Guides might take on a more casual, expository voice. Quick Guides would consist mainly of a brief explanation, and then a break down of steps to follow, either in a table or separated by bullet points or numbering.</p>
<h4>Security</h4>
<p>We will be able to designate some articles and/or section of articles as “Members only.” Membership within the context of the helpdesk would be defined as those individuals who have an account within our helpdesk system. Ideally, we would be able to link between the helpdesk site and our own using SSO, so that users would only need to have one account and/or log in one time on EduGuide.org before they can use our help resources. Users can also interact with us without creating a new account first.</p>
<p>One occasion which might require login on the helpdesk system involves the delivery of our team resources within the support site. These are the documents which are currently available in the team library, and while we want to make them easily accessible to team coaches, we want to limit their exposure so that they can not be used by the general public.</p>
<p>To store the documents, we would create an entry containing a brief description. We would then either attach the original resource as a file, or we would paste it in as a part of the article. Users can then download/print off the information.</p>
<h3>Community</h3>
<p>We would also offer a “community forum,” where visitors and support site members will be able to submit questions, suggestions, or notes that do not directly relate to an issue or a question they have about the website. This area of the Support Site is intended to be open ended and more casual than the Knowledgebase. It also allows us to cover topics that may not be of interest to enough people, or to address issues or questions with solutions that are not entirely proven. </p>
<h4>Moderation</h4>
<p>All of the posts created by support site members and web visitors would be held for review before they are published on the site. Posts that we consider to be valid but too specific to publish in the forum would be retained and responded to privately via an email and/or ticket.</p>
<h3>Live Chat</h3>
<p>As described above, live chat will be integrated with the options of viewing the knowledgebase or opening up a ticket. The chat feature will primarily be used for user support, but with the purchase of enough licenses, it could be expanded to include marketing and outreach.</p>
<p>It will also be possible to show the live chat tab on the non-platform pages instead of the knowledgebase/contact us tab. This allows us to more specifically direct potential partners reaching out to us via chat. Conversation with a salesperson might seem more relevant than our knowledgebase at that stage. They would be directed to open a ticket if nobody is available for chat.</p>
<p></p>
<p>PAGE_BREAK: PageBreak</p>
<h2>User Friendly Design</h2>
<p>The aspect of our support system will be the imagery and the messages appearing on the site. These developments will help to bridge everything together. Even if a user has decided to contact the helpdesk, at first we will  want to be sure we are providing them with directions and visual cues in order to nudge them closer to an answer. Another reason these elements are important is that they make it easier for us to support the platform.</p>
<h3>Consistent Communication</h3>
<p>For example, if there is a button on the site with a picture of a gear, and we have a common vocabulary for labelling it  an “options menu,” then this term can be used during marketing meetings, training, in knowledgebase articles, during chats, and inside on-screen system messages. Reinforcing the term in all of our communication helps the user remember the label and its function, so it is easier for them to find it when they need it, or they can reference it when they are asking a questions. We would not want to invent a term for every single element on our site necessarily, just the ones that are the most prominent or serve to build the overall brand of the site. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Navigation menu next to the logo</li>
<li>Side path menu</li>
<li>“Gear” icon in team navigation</li>
<li>Filter, sorting, and search controls in metrics, member management, group management, coach management</li>
</ul>
<h3> Intuitive controls following a human-centric logic</h3>
<p>When the production designer for the original “Star Trek” planned out the original controls on the set for the <i>Enterprise </i>bridge, they sat in a chair and mapped out where the buttons and switches that would logically be positioned from their perspective. The layout of the bridge controls add a dimension of reality to a fictional universe, in order to for it to make sense to the audience at home.</p>
<p>Our site should follow the same principle. Menus and links should be displayed on the screen based on their importance and/or how often they’re used. Other controls such as fields should also be clearly labeled. In addition to helping users understand what they should do next, visual cues such as these help with training and user support, and help keep the site more consistent.</p>
<p><img src="http://cyberland.gazerbeam.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/null-22.png" width="624" height="332" alt="" title=""></p>
<p>For example, in the image above the three items listed on the team’s main navigation are “Dashboard,” “Goals,” and “Library.” Two of these pages are used often by Core Learning team coaches. But, if I am a core learning team coach, I might be on this page looking for keywords in the navigation such as “groups,” “path,” or “students.” There is a gear icon, but I wouldn’t know without clicking on it what is there. I might assume the icon is for configuring the team.</p>
<p>The metrics links on the side of the page take you to the metrics page when you click on them, but this isn’t obvious to new users until they click on them and see what happens. There would have been a tooltip pointing this out upon joining the site, and this was explained in training, but we can’t count on users to remember this. We’ve also run into an issue in the past with the Metrics page not being available until there were stats being shown on the team dashboard (the stats only show up when there are numbers to show that are one or higher). This detracts from the consistency for the site.</p>
<p><img src="http://cyberland.gazerbeam.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/null-23.png" width="624" height="332" alt="" title=""></p>
<p>The filter controls in the image above are displayed without labels, so users must infer from their current values what their functions are. The problem is that these values change as users adjust them. If the user has questions about these functions, or if we were trying to explain how they work, it is difficult to refer to them spatially because there isn’t a label for us to refer to.</p>
<h3>Logical Relationships between features</h3>
<p>On the show “Star Trek,” there were consoles which each controlled a different aspect of the ship’s functions. Captain Kirk always knew which direction he needed to turn to when he wanted to talk to Mr. Spock or Scotty. But, Bones never had a station to sit in front of on the bridge. Our system should use layers, navigational elements, and other cues to communicate how features relate to each other.</p>
<p>Many of the concepts that we communicate to our users are throwbacks to older versions of our platform, so they may not make as much as sense now as they once did. For example, we tell teachers that their students must join their teams, but the students never really interact with the team that they are a member of. We also have several pages, such as metrics, members, coaches, and groups, that are considered to be inside the team, but are presented inside a differently styled design.</p>
<p>What is a coach’s homepage on the site? In the past, it was the team dashboard, but perhaps now it is the Metrics page now that they are taken there when they log in. If so, we would want to make sure that they can accomplish everything that they need to from this page, and that it is easy for them to get back.</p>
<p>We should also seek terminology and concepts which best align with standards that teachers are already familiar with. We could, for example, refer to the Members page as a “Roster,” and we could call the Metrics page a “Gradebook,” in keeping with terms that teachers use.</p>
<h3>Voice and Branding</h3>
<p>It would also be helpful to establish branding for the site. This could, in turn, help us to develop the site’s personality. This would help to guide the words and phrasing we use in different types of messaging, including system messages and notifications.</p>
<p>One of the things that makes Slack popular is its use of casual language throughout its messaging and prompts. In the past, while using Mailchimp it was fun to see tips and instructions delivered inside a speech bubble coming out of the picture of a cartoon chimp. Messaging that is informative and fun can make a site more enjoyable to use overall.</p>

<h2><s>Behavior Based User Guides</s></h2>
<p><s>Imagine if we were an airline, and our customers were passengers on our planes. We would want to attract their business, track the purchase of their ticket, ensure their successful boarding for their flight, keep them comfortable while they were in the air, ensure that their luggage was returned to them upon landing, and follow up with questions designed to measure their satisfaction.</s></p>
<p><s>We are not an airline company, but we basically want to accomplish the same thing for our users, and we want to improve their experience. It is as important to us to be able study their behavior and preferences as any other company or organization.</s></p>
<p><s>While we do not have the benefit of offering service in real life, or a staff to offer on-site customer service like an airline would, there are ways in which our members’ own behavior could trigger messaging that appears at the right time and directs them to take a next step.</s></p>
<h3><s>Tracking User Behavior</s></h3>
<p><s>Our conversion funnel tracks key steps users need to take such as joining the site, launching team, adding students, etc, but we are challenged by our inability to know when a user has completed a step and send them an appropriate message.</s></p>
<p><s>WebEngage makes it possible to group users together into segment, and then send them messaging on different channels based on their behavior or preference. It would allow us to integrate our onboarding messaging with on-screen support seamlessly, and share information with them precisely when they need it.</s></p>
<h4><s>Identifying Milestones</s></h4>
<p><s>Our first step in designing an onboarding strategy would be to identify all of the milestones we want coaches to reach after they’ve joined the site. These might include:</s></p>
<ul>
<li><s>Launching the team</s></li>
<li><s>Adding Coaches</s></li>
<li><s>Creating Groups</s></li>
<li><s>Reviewing team library documents</s></li>
<li><s>Adding Students</s></li>
<li><s>Completing path</s></li>
<li><s>Reviewing their first students’ path</s></li>
<li><s>Reviewing 5 students’ path progress</s></li>
<li><s>Reviewing every students’ path in their group</s></li>
<li><s>Responding to their first student</s></li>
<li><s>Responding to coach in PD path</s></li>
<li><s>Sending invitation for IT Test</s></li>
</ul>
<h3><s>Communicate Expectations to Coaches</s></h3>
<p><s>Next, we would communicate these expectations to Coaches in a dynamically generated checklist which would be shown to them initially, but can be hidden and open back up at any time that they choose. This could be inside a separate page, displayed in a modal, or a section that expands and contracts with the click of the button. Inside, there would be a list of the steps coaches need to take as they are getting started. These would be presented as suggestions. Team Captains would be able to track their coaches’ progress with these steps from a page similar to the pages we use for goals. Team captains would also be able to send coaches email reminders or private web-based messages.</s></p>
<p><s>When the coach is ready, they can click the checkbox next to a step in order to mark it as clear. Some action-based tasks would also be marked complete when the coach completes them, such as when they launch their personal path for the first time.</s></p>
<p><s>On the backend, we would track coaches’ behavior and display an activity feed to EG Admins which would help us to follow along with the coaches’ progress. This would show us every action they’ve taken, so it would be raw data. Some activity might be shared with admin coaches and/or team captains either in the team membership record page, or elsewhere. That way, not only will leadership for the team know when coaches have completed certain tasks, but when changes are made and who made them such as creating or deleting a group.</s></p>
<p><s>Once the checklist is completed, this design element would disappear. But, we might display it again during the renewal process.</s></p>
<h3><s>Behavior Triggered Messaging</s></h3>
<p><s>Once we have established the list of milestones, and we’ve communicated the expectations to Coaches, we can track their behavior and send them messages as they complete or fail to complete certain steps.</s></p>
<p><s>As a new member joins the site, their information would be transferred to WebEngage via an API. They would be added to user segments based on criteria such as:</s></p>
<ul>
<li><s>Join Date</s></li>
<li><s>Team Name</s></li>
<li><s>Team Role</s></li>
<li><s>Coach Level</s></li>
<li><s>Pages visited</s></li>
</ul>
<p><s>We could set up a flow in WebEngage which would detect a new coach on the site who has not started their path after seven days. Coaches who fall under this criteria would be sent an email, and we could display a message on their screen reminding them to start their path the next time that they log in.</s></p>
<p><s>Brand new coaches who visit the metrics could be shown a message which describes how key parts of the page works, and direct them to a full article in our knowledgebase. </s></p>
<p><s>Depending on the data that we are capturing, we would be able to send coaches messages of encouragement when they’ve completed their first activity, posted a certain number of comments on students’ paths, etc.</s></p>
<p><s>Through WebEngage we would be able to automatically send an email or a text message to coaches who haven’t logged in after a certain number of months.</s></p>
<p><s>We could send similar reminders to students who haven’t logged in for a while, or prompt them to contact our helpdesk in case there is a problem.</s></p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>The challenge of improving our user support system requires work and thinking that is user-centric, thorough, and inclusive of many areas or processes within the organization. In order to serve our users well, we must strive to develop a platform which is intuitive enough that users are able to use it and EG admins are able to support it with minimal effort. This means planning out new features or functions with the user in mind, and always asking ourselves how well we would be able to explain its usage on paper, in a short video, or during a training.</p>
<p>The best way to ensure good quality on the site is to incorporate users’ feedback into our planning and development process. <i>We need to ask our users questions, listen to their answers, and build a site that meets their needs first.</i> We need to make decisions based on evidence gathered from our research, instead of basing them on hypotheses and inferences.</p>
<p>We need to show who and what the website is through branding, voice, and the structure. This will in turn help us to establish guidelines for writing content for the web and on different channels, and understanding the relationship between the features will make it easier to describe to the users. Our messaging should also stay consistent including the use of established terminology for important elements on the website.</p>
<p>The user research, branding, and consistency will form the foundation for a strong user support system. We can use our conversations with users to determine the areas that need the most attention, and then address these weaknesses with knowledgebase articles, triggered messages, and on-screen text.</p>
<p>A stronger foundation would also help with live communication about the platform, such as during live chats, outreach/presentation, and phone support calls.</p>
<p>The Community Support Committee would meet to review feedback from users, drafts of support materials, submitted bugs, or other descriptions of issues on the site and recommend an action. They would also give the development team feedback on new features as they are being planned or developed.</p>

<h2>Select and Implement User Support Helpdesk</h2>
<p>I have been looking at three candidates which could suit our needs for a user support desk: Desk.com, Freshdesk, and Zendesk. I liked Zendesk’s simpler design style and modular approach to its features (live chat, knowledgebase, helpdesk). Its live chat is very similar to Olark, which we would be switching away from. You can also choose to either search the Zenddesk knowledgebase or communicate with the support team.</p>
<p>We’ve been using Freshdesk for a few years, and it has a strong integration with the site. I am still learning more about whether or not we can offer a “chat” link inside the open a ticket/knowledgebase widget which I find to already be quite intuitive.</p>
<p>Salesforce offers many of the same features as the other two services, but its chat feature is closer to Freshdesk than Zendesk/Olark, and I am still not clear about how we would integrated it into our site. All three offer integrations with Salesforce, and all three would offer a non profit discount.</p>
<p>My recommendation is that we purchase a subscription to Zendesk’s chat, knowledgebase, and support desk solutions. It’s interface and philosophies meet the needs of a small operation like ours. As a second choice, we should consider Freshdesk.</p>

<h2>Implement Web Engage</h2>
<p>Web Engage is a service which allows us to deliver messages, reminders, and other information via different channels to users who fit within a set segment. Messages can be sent as on-site notifications, SMS messages, or emails. We can set these to be triggered by users who fall under a specific set of parameters. We can also create “Journeys” which are a series of messages that are triggered when a user fits within a segment, such as “new user who hasn’t logged on in 3 months.” In the example I was shown, a user flow could be created which is basically a series of “if, then” actions: “If they don’t log in within 7 days, then send an email. If the email bounces, then send a SMS message.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Pricing is based on the number of messages and actions used. We would also need to integrate with third parties such as Twilio and Sendgrid if we wanted to use it with email/SMS.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The advantage of using a service like this is not only that we can push out messages based on behavior and data, but we can gather insight into how users are interacting with the site, and adjust our messaging accordingly. This also provides us with a way to post announcements and other communications to our users. We could, for example, pop up a message for all coaches, or just the members of the NCAN.</p>
