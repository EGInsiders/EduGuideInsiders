<h2>Acknowledge Feelings</h2>
<ul>
<li>It sounds like that must have made you upset/frustrated/overwhelmed/stressed.</li>
<li>Sometimes when that happens we can feel upset/frustrated/overwhelmed/stressed.</li>
<li>Let me know if you would like to talk about that more.</li>
<li>That must be difficult. I’m sorry to hear about this.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ensure Comprehension</h2>
<ul>
<li>Describe …?</li>
<li>What does … mean?</li>
<li>What stood out to you about this quote/video/text/website?</li>
<li>What are some similarities and differences between these ideas?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Seek Clarification</h2>
<ul>
<li>When you say … describe what you mean?</li>
<li>Could you give me more details about that?</li>
<li>I’m not sure I understand what you are saying. Please tell me more.</li>
<li>Could you give me another example of what you’re saying?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Incite Investigation</h2>
<ul>
<li>Could you tell me more about ...?</li>
<li>How did ... happen?</li>
<li>Why do you think ... happened?</li>
<li>What made you do/feel/say/think that? </li>
</ul>
<h2>Urge Further Reflection</h2>
<ul>
<li>Did you expect ... to happen?</li>
<li>When you said ... what did you mean? </li>
<li>What would make this a higher priority for you? </li>
<li>What did you do/feel/say/think when ... happened? </li>
</ul>
<h2>Fuel Action</h2>
<ul>
<li>Have you had a chance to try …?</li>
<li>Did you get a chance to practice …?</li>
<li>What do you think you could do to make … happen?</li>
<li>How big of a priority is changing this for you, from a low of 1 to a high of 10?</li>
</ul>
<p>Take a moment to reflect with other Team Coaches about some other open-ended questions that could be used to continue the conversations with students.</p>
<p>Share your questions with one another to offer support in the mentoring process.</p>
