Support coaches are invited to join EduGuide so that they can monitor and coach targeted students. The level of coaching a Support Coach will provide should be discussed with his or her organizationâ€™s EduGuide Team Captain. Below are general duties of a Support Coach.
<h2>Annual Responsibilities</h2>
<b>1. Continually grow your impact as a coach.</b>
<ul>
 	<li>Upon receiving an email invitation, join EduGuide and start the online orientation PD activity. This activity is longer than others and may take up to an hour. It covers the basic elements of working with the program.</li>
 	<li>Continue to do weekly PD version of student activities to learn how to coach students in building key mindsets and skills. These activities average about 15 minutes each, though some people like to spend more time with them.</li>
</ul>
<b>2. Identify groups or people to follow.</b>
<ul>
 	<li>After the Lead Coaches have created their groups and started their students, select people you want to follow. You can choose an existing group of students. Or you can create a custom group and add selected students to it. You can even select other coaches you want to follow, or your Team Captain may ask you to support specific people.</li>
</ul>
<b>3. Regularly coach people on their activities.</b>
<ul>
 	<li>Set a goal for a specific time each week to log in to EduGuide for 15 minutes and coach at least one person. You can even do it from your phone.</li>
</ul>
