<h1>EduGuide Update</h1>
<h2>October 16, 2018</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Yesterday, EduGuide’s support team responded to issues that students from Pacific High School were experiencing as they joined or logged into their accounts on EduGuide.org. Last night, we identified the cause and implemented a change to students’ accounts so that now and moving forward, they should be able to access their paths.</p>
<p>I apologize for any inconvenience that this might have caused for both staff and students. We will continue to review our system for any areas that require improvement.</p>
<p>Please continue to contact EduGuide’s support desk if your students experience any issues while they are using the path system, or if you have any general questions about the site. You can contact us by clicking on “Help & Feedback” in the main navigation, or by sending an email message to <a href="mailto:web@eduguide.org">web@eduguide.org</a>. We are also available during business hours via live chat. Click “Chat with Us” to request a session.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Jon Morgan</p>
