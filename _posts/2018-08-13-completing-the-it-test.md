<p>The IT Test is a process which is used by EduGuide coaches to verify that their students will have the best experience possible while working on their personal paths. During IT Testing, the technician who is completing the test will be asked a series of questions about the configuration of their building’s network. They will then be asked to complete a brief test path and then send feedback on whether or not everything looked correct. This final determination helps to determine if the test has passed or failed, and if the team is ready for the students.</p>
<h2>Team Setup Process</h2>
<p>Coaches trigger the IT Test as they are completing the steps listed in their team’s setup page. They are prompted to enter in the email address of their Network Administrator.</p>
<p>When you are asked to complete the IT Test, you would have received the following invitation from Eduguide.</p>

<p>When you click “Learn More & Run IT Test,” you will be taken to the site and prompted to either log into an existing account, or create a new one. When you join the site, you will not be joining the same team as the coach who sent you the request. Instead, you will be joining a team which was created specifically for computer technicians. You will also be taken immediately into the IT testing process.</p>

<h2>Network Configuration</h2>

<p>The first part of the test will walk you through screens which ask you about your network’s configuration. You will be asked to open up access on your network to EduGuide’s domain, and to run a check of the software on the computer that you are using. It would be ideal if these steps were completed while you are using a student’s computer.</p>
<p>You will be asked to allow traffic to the following domain names:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eduguide.org</li>
<li>*.eduguide.org </li>
<li>*.amazonaws.com </li>
<li>*.cloudfront.net</li>
<li>Whitelist eduguide.org on your email server</li>
</ul>
<h3>Computer System Check</h3>

<p>The next screen will remind you that EduGuide’s site is compatible with the following browsers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chrome 25 or higher</li>
<li>Safari 6 or higher</li>
<li>Firefox 21 or higher</li>
<li>Internet Explorer 9 or higher</li>
<li>Microsoft Edge</li>
</ul>
<h3>Compatibility</h3>

<p>The final page will run a test of different technologies that the site uses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Javascript supported</li>
<li>Cookies supported</li>
<li>AJAX supported</li>
<li>HINCLUDE supported</li>
</ul>
<p>After the test runs, green check marks will appear next to each item that passed, and an “x” will appear next to an item that failed. Please notify EduGuide of any items that failed.</p>
<h2>Path Test</h2>
<p>The last portion of the IT Test will take you through a brief path which is designed to test the different types of steps and functionality that are used in the activities. The test path covers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Responses to discussion posts</li>
<li>Videos</li>
<li>Responses to Essay questions</li>
<li>Poll questions</li>
<li>Displaying of text and graphics</li>
</ul>
<p>Make a note of anything that looks unusual on the screen as you run through the path. The very last step will ask you to pass or fail the test. If you mark the test as failed, you will be asked to include feedback as to why the test failed.</p>
