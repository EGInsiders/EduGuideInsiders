<h2>A:</h2>
You can find a group’s join code by first clicking on the “Invite Members” button located to the left of the group’s title.

You can only access the groups that you follow. The groups that you have followed will be listed under the “My Groups” header on the group management page.
<h2>Following Groups</h2>
To follow a group, click on the button labeled “Follow” that is located to the left of a group’s name. The system will confirm that you’ve followed the group, and the button’s label will change to “Invite Members.”

You may need to refresh the page before the group you just followed appears under the “My Groups” header.
<h2>Inviting Students</h2>
When you click on the “Invite Members” button, you will be taken to a page which shows a join code and address for the group.

Click on the corresponding buttons to copy either the group’s join code or the group’s address to your clipboard.
<h2>Adding existing students to a Group</h2>
You can also add students to your group who are already on the team by clicking “View List.” You will be taken to a page for the group where you will be able to add students as group members, or add coaches as followers.
