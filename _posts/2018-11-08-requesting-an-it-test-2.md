<p>Coaches can use the IT Testing tool in the Team Setup page to ask their IT professional or technology person to test the EduGuide platform on their school’s hardware. Coaches are encouraged to complete the testing when they are launching or re launching  a team, but they can also request the IT test at any time if they suspect that there is a problem.</p>
<h2>Accessing the IT Testing Tool</h2>
<p>Click “Setup” inside your team’s sub navigation list inside the main menu. The IT Testing form can be found towards the top of the setup page.</p>

<p></p>
<p>To request an IT Test:</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>Enter the email address for your building’s technology coordinator or a district’s field technician into the space provided underneath the label “User.”</li>
<li>Click “Save.”</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p>A screen will appear where you can enter in a custom message and double check the email address. When you are satisfied, click “Send Invite.”</p>

<p></p>
<h2>Monitoring the testing progress</h2>
<p>Later, you can return to the setup page and check on the progress of the IT Testing. When your designated IT Tester has begun their process, the test’s status will change to “Started.” Once they complete the test, it’s status will appear as either “passed,” or “failed,” depending on their feedback at the end of the process.</p>
