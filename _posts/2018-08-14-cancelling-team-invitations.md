<p>This article will describe the steps to follow when you need to cancel a pending invitation. This might be necessary if you ever experience a staff change prior to the launch of your team, or you discover that one of the email addresses entered in contains a typo.</p>
<p></p>
<p>These steps are the same for the IT Testing, Select Captain, and Invite Coaches sections of the Team Setup page.</p>
