<h2>A:</h2>
The numbers shown in the weekly path reports are based on the number of activities completed, not steps. A step is the single page that you view inside a path. It can ask a question and prompt a response, display media such as a video or photo, or just text. Progress within the activity is measured by the step completed. This is indicated in the progress bar thatâ€™s displayed on the screen. But, the weekly reports show progress based on activities.
