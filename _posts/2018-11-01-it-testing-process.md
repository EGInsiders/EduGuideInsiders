<p>Welcome back to “EduGuide Insider,” where we explore the features and best practices behind the EduGuide web platform. I’m Nicole Chickering, Results Coach for EduGuide, and in this video I’m going to be reviewing the IT testing process and its benefits.</p>

UNSUPPORTED: UnsupportedElement<p>## What is IT Testing?</p>

<p>IT Testing is a process through which a coach asks a technology manager for their building or district to complete a brief online test that  walks them through changes that need to be made to the network, and allows them to run through a sample path which was designed to test the most common elements of an activity.</p>

<p>The configuration portion of the test asks the technician to white list EduGuide’s URL and the email addresses which EduGuide uses when it sends out team invitations and other notifications. This also helps to ensure that EduGuide staff will be able to communicate with coaches from their individual business email addresses.</p>

<p>There is also a portion of the configuration test which runs a check of the software that is on the computer they are testing with. This is why it’s important that IT Technicians test using a type of device that is typically used by students.</p>

<p>During the path test, testers will be taken through a series of steps which contain a video, discussion question, image, and text. After the tester has completed the activity, they will be prompted to report whether the test passed or failed.</p>

<p>Typically, coaches will request an IT test as they are setting up their team and sending join invitations to their colleagues. This testing should take place when the team is brand-new and launching for students for the first time, or as staff and students are returning for another year.</p>

<p>When you send the IT testing request, you will begin by entering in the email address of the computer technician who you would like to contact about conducting the test. Ideally, this would be someone who is a part of your school’s technology team, and who is not already serving as a coach.</p>

<p>After you send the request, a status will appear indicating how much progress has been made. Once the testing is complete, you should see a new note of “Pass” or “Fail,” depending on the technician’s response at the end of the test.</p>

<p>Once you see that the IT Testing has been completed and passed, you can proceed with confidence with the launch of the team and  begin adding students.</p>
