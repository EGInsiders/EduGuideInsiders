<h2>EduGuide Website Update 11/1/2018</h2>
<p></p>
<p>This week, EduGuide rolled out a number of features and improvements for its website:</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li><b>“Fake answers” detection. </b>The site can now detect when students attempt to defeat the word count minimum by entering in placeholder text; for example, the same repeated word or nonsense words. Starting this week, if a student enters a response to a question that appears to be nonsense, a message will appear on the page which politely asks them to revise their response.</li>
<li><b>Distress detection.</b> If a student’s response in the path system contains a word that might indicate that that they are depressed or in trouble, their comment will be logged. Coaches will also be contacted if the comment indicates that more action is needed.</li>
<li><b>Improvements to the regrouping process for students.</b> If a student is shown a message saying that their subscription is invalid or expired, they can renew their subscription by clicking on a link and then entering in a new group code.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p>If you have any questions or feedback about these changes, please send them via email to <a href="mailto:web@eduguide.org">web@eduguide.org</a>.</p>
