<p>Eduguide.org is an award-winning online learning and coaching platform that provides evidence-based social-emotional learning (SEL) activities and tools to assist organizations with their mentoring and communication needs and help students succeed. The program aims at setting and achieving long-term goals by harnessing students’ passions and shaping their mindset toward overcoming obstacles.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Students complete up to 20 short activities per year, some in as little as 15 minutes, using a tablet, computer, or phone. These activities train students to engage and collaborate with each other while developing skills and habits that help them to set and achieve their goals. Students become motivated, confident, and self-driven learners who listen better to feedback, participate more in class, and do more homework. The result is sustained higher achievement, both academically as well as in life, with students building a strong sense of collaboration and learning to contribute to their families and communities.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The eduguide.org platform helps meet the development and mentoring goals with a 3-part system:</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li><b>Path</b> – EduGuide delivers development materials for educational professionals and online character-building lessons for students. These self-paced online activities can be completed by students in class or on their own time as part of a class-participation grade at college level. A faculty member, coach, or mentor works with students on the activities providing them with questions and suggestions in order to encourage engagement and collaboration.</li>
<li><b>Team</b> – This includes students and coaches who communicate via a discussion board and document library. Coaches help  students to set personal goals and a common purpose, while also collaborating with them on social and emotional issues that students care about.</li>
<li><b>Goals</b> – Team coaches assign specific goals to members, or individuals can assign goals to themselves. Every year, students complete new activities which help them develop the necessary skills to achieve these goals. These activities also enable students to build upon what they’ve already learned by reinforcing and strengthening these positive habits.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p>EduGuide works by focussing on core strength training for the mind and it delivers measurable success. Students show improvement in academic performance, increased GPA by .3 grade points, while also learning to focus and stay on tasks. Results include increased degree completion and closed achievement gaps.</p>
