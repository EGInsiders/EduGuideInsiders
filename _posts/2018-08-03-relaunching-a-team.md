When the path subscription on your team expires, the following items will be automatically archived:
<ul>
 	<li>Students</li>
 	<li>Groups</li>
</ul>
When you return for the following year, you will find that groups and students will be marked as “archived.” Admin coaches will also be automatically directed to the team setup page where they will be asked to review your team’s settings and make any necessary changes.
<h2>Relaunching your Team</h2>
During the process of relaunching your team, you will want to complete the following steps:
<ul>
 	<li>Invite any new coaches, and eliminate any coaches who will not be returning to the team</li>
 	<li>Ask for a new IT Test</li>
 	<li>Create or edit groups</li>
</ul>
<h2>Getting Students Started</h2>
Instruct your students who will be returning to your team to go to http://login.eduguide.org and enter in their account credentials. Returning students will be prompted for your group code after they login. They will see a message on the screen which will ask them to enter in a new code.

New students should go to http://join.eduguide.org and use the code for your group to register for a new account on the site.
