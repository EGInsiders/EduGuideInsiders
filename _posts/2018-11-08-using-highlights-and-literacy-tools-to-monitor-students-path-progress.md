<p>Coaches can use the Highlights feature to capture and share students’ comments with other coaches on the team. They can also monitor students’ usage of the literacy tools from the metrics tool.</p>
<h2>Creating a Highlight</h2>

<p></p>
<ol>
<li>While you are reviewing a student’s response in the metrics page, select the comment or portion of text that you would like to reference in the highlight.</li>
<li>A toolbar will appear at the bottom of the screen</li>
<li>Click “Highlight” inside the bar at the bottom of the screen.</li>
<li>A modal will appear where you can select the folder where your highlight will be saved. You can choose to save the highlight to a private or team folder.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Managing Highlight Folders</h2>
<p>All coaches are provided with a “personal” folder by default, but you can create a custom folder if you would like. Custom folders are handy when you want to follow a particular student’s comments, save subjects or topics that are mentioned by students in their comments, or track progress being made on skills.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the “Add” link, then enter in a name for the new folder and then click “Create.”</li>
<li>The new folder will then be shown in the list along the side of the modal.</li>
<li>The teams where you can share the students’ comment or text excerpt will be listed along the left side of the modal.</li>
<li>Select the team that you would like to post the highlight under if you would like to share it with all coaches on the team.</li>
</ol>
<p>After you create a highlight in a students’ step, the link “Saved Highlights” will appear. Clicking the link will open up the highlight modal where you can view the contents of any of the comments that have been highlighted in order to reference that specific step.</p>

<h2>Viewing your Highlights page</h2>
<p></p>
<p>You can also view your saved highlights from inside your “Highlights” page. Click “Highlights” inside the main menu to view the page.</p>
<p>Within the Highlights page, you can filter your saved highlights by folder.</p>
<h3>Saving and Deleting Highlights</h3>
<p>Click the option menu to either delete or edit a saved Highlight. The option menu will display as three vertical dots.</p>
<h4>Deleting a Highlight</h4>
<p>To delete a highlight, click the menu icon and then click “Delete.” You will be asked to confirm the deletion. Click “Yes” to confirm.</p>
<h4>Editing a Highlight</h4>
<p>When you click “Edit,” you will be taken to a screen where you can change which folder the highlight is saved in. Make the change, and then click “Update Highlight” to save and then return to the previous screen.</p>
