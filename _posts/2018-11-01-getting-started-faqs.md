<p><b>Getting Started FAQs </b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>Q: How much time will EduGuide require ? </b></p>
<p>One of EduGuide’s goals is to build regular habits for reflection and relationships in 15-minute increments. Activities are set up so they can easily be completed in multiple sessions per week, allowing the successful student to develop the regular habit of reflecting with EduGuide.</p>
<p></p>
<p>After the first week, Coaches are encouraged to respond to student comments in 15-minute per week.  This is enough time to build relationship bonds. If Coaches have more time available,  EduGuide offers offline Discussion Guides and other Resources to use. A successful Coach will build regular habits and relationships with students even if they only have 15-minutes increments. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Q: Can EduGuide actually save time?</b></p>
<p>The more time students and coaches allot to using EduGuide, the more success they will have from using it. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Most participants  see faster growth with more participation, homework completion, grades, listening and self-motivation. EduGuide also saves time with ready-made activities for students to complete on their own. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Q. What if I’m not sure how to respond to a student?</b></p>
<p>A Coach can use a suggested response from the online library if they’re at a loss for words. A response to every student comment, however, is not necessary as a student should complete the exercises much like a journal entry; requiring only an occasional response, comment or quip from a coach. Coaches are not expected to solve a student’s problems, instead their role is simply to provide encouragement, understanding and maybe a question or comment that helps a student self-reflect.</p>
<p></p>
<p>An example of a coach comment could be, “Good point, why do you think that is?” </p>
<p>Or, if a student is sharing something sensitive, a coach may put more thought and insight into a comment. </p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>Q. How do I track and respond to my students?</b></p>
<p>Your Metrics page will sort your students by most or least comments posted and alphabetically or reverse alphabetically.  Just select the student from your list of participants. This will allow you to track that particular student and send a response.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Q. How will students know when someone responds to their comments?</b></p>
<p>A student will be notified via email when you respond to them and they will be reminded to check their responses when they log in. </p>
<p></p>
<p>A Coach will be notified in the same way when they are sent a comment or response from a student.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Q. How many activities are available for the year and how fast can students complete  them?</b></p>
<p>A typical EduGuide Path has 20 activities per year. EduGuide suggests that activities are completed once per week. Students may complete an activity at their own pace, but they are limited to one activity per day to ensure they are given time for reflection and learning.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Q. How do I engage a reluctant learner?</b></p>
<p>Be sure to respond to a student’s first activity comments in a timely manner to ensure that the student knows you are reading their responses and you care about what they write. Consider using EduGuide’s Offline Discussion Guides for positive response suggestions</p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>Q. How can I lead a group discussion if my students are all working on different activities?</b></p>
<p>Pick the activity you want to discuss. For students who haven’t completed the topic yet, the discussion will be an excellent preview of the activity. For students who have already completed the activity, discussing it with them may provide inspiring incentive for them to contribute more writing to the exercise.</p>
