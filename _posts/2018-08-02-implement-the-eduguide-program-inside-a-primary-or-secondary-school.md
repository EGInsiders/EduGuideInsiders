<h2>Before your team is created</h2>
You need to select the members of your staff or department who will serve as coaches. Then discuss the best strategies for organizing and managing students in the EduGuide Program before your team launches. The EduGuide program is adaptable but be sure to plan for an approach that works best for the team.
<h3>Who should serve as coaches?</h3>
EduGuide teams offer three coaching roles: Admin, Lead, and Support. You will want to select a handful of staff members who can serve as admin coaches, and most classroom teachers will be lead coaches. The support coach role can be assigned to those who will be observing students or assisting admin and lead coaches.
<h3>What do coaches need in order to get started on the team?</h3>
<h4>Hardware Requirements</h4>
Coaches can use a laptop, desktop, tablet, or mobile device to to register on the site; however, things might go more smoothly if they use a computer.
<h4>Registration Information</h4>
When teachers register on the site, they will be asked to input four pieces of information:
<ul>
 	<li>Job Role at the Organization</li>
 	<li>Organization Name</li>
 	<li>Email Address (username)</li>
 	<li>Password</li>
</ul>
It is important to remember the email address and password used to register as they will be required to log-on to the program.
<h4>Student Information</h4>
It helps to have a class list available so that you can compare it to the list of students in your group with the team.
<h4>General Understanding of the Platform and Path system</h4>
The site can be broken up into three main areas:
<ul>
 	<li>Your personal account</li>
 	<li>Team, Team management, and Metrics</li>
 	<li>Path System</li>
</ul>
Coaches will have access to all three parts, but students only have access to the path system and their personal account area.

Coaches will spend the most time inside the Metrics area where they can track students’ progress and respond to comments. The team library will also contain helpful information about coaching students in the path and the EduGuide Program.

When coaches join the site, they will be automatically taken into their professional path. The path coaches complete covers the same lessons as the students’ path, but includes additional notes and additional tips for teachers. The very first activity in the professional path provides an orientation of the EduGuide program as well as video tutorial.
<h3>What naming convention should we use for the groups?</h3>
How you name your groups will also depend on how you are organizing your students, and also the different ways in which you will be grouping your students together.

This is important because other than helping to organize the students within the team groups:
<ul>
 	<li>Are used to filter the views in the Metrics page</li>
 	<li>Can be followed by coaches</li>
 	<li>Coaches who follow a specific group will get regular reports related to that group via email</li>
</ul>
<h3>What materials or equipment do students need?</h3>
Similar to coaches, students can access the EduGuide website via a computer, handheld, or mobile device. During registration, students will be asked for their name, email address, and a password. It is important that they remember the email address and password that they enter during registration, because they will be use them later to log back in.
<h3>When will students begin?</h3>
This date will depend on your school’s schedule. When you setup your team, you will be prompted for a student start date. This date is also included in the invitations that are sent to other coaches.
<h3>Who will you contact locally when you have technical questions?</h3>
It would be helpful to give your IT department or consultant firm a heads<s>- </s>-up that your school will be using EduGuide’s online program. Also, let them know that you will be asking for their help running an IT test for their team. During setup, you will be prompted for the email address of an IT technician who supports your school.
<h3>When should we hold a staff launch meeting?</h3>
As a part of your launch process, you will be prompted to set up a date for your team’s launch meeting. This is a chance to share more about the EduGuide Program and answer any of the above questions that still need clarification.
<h2>Team Setup</h2>
Team setup goes very quickly once your Team has been created and Coaches begin responding to Invitations. Only Admin Coaches and Team Captains are automatically shown the eam Setup page as they join the site so that they have an opportunity to respond. Lead and Support Coaches are not shown the Team Setup pages and are taken directly into their path when they log in.

They will be asked for the following:
<ul>
 	<li><b>Auto Groups </b>- Auto Groups is turned on by default, but the step in the Team Setup page will give you the option of turning it off if you wish. This depends on how you will be using groups in the team. When auto groups is turned on, groups will automatically be created when lead coaches join If you do not want this to happen, or if you prefer to create all groups manually, then you may want to turn this feature off.Groups will not be automatically created for support coaches. They will have to be manually created if the autogrouping is turned off.</li>
 	<li><b>Invite Team Captains</b> - Team Captains have all of the same abilities as Admin Coaches, but serve as a coordinator for the team, assisting coaches with questions and ensuring that everything in the team goes smoothly.Team Captains and Admin Coaches are the primary contacts for coordinated communication. Team Captains will schedule support for implementation with their EduGuide Results Coach.</li>
 	<li><b>Schedule IT Testing.</b> You will want to schedule IT Testing as soon as possible so that EduGuide’s website can be tested and any issues resolved before your students begin to join your team. During the IT testing process, your network administrator or technician will be asked to confirm the configuration of your school’s organization as well as complete a series of sample activities.</li>
 	<li><b>Invite Team Coaches</b> - This is where you go when you are ready to invite coaches to the team, but also the place to check when you have questions about the status of your invitations. You can also send send reminder invitations to those coaches that are late in joining the team or emails to coaches reminding them to get started with their student groups.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Prior to Launching with students</h2>
There are a number of actions coaches can take after setup has begun on the team, but before their team has been launched.
<ul>
 	<li><b>Review the resources in your team library.</b> Many of the documents in the library offer information and tips on how to coach students in the path system. [Click here to view a full list of the document titles]{URL}</li>
 	<li><b>Complete your professional path.</b> The activities will give you an idea of topics students will be asked, and the types of questions they will be asked.</li>
 	<li><b>Finalize your group structure</b>. Make a note of the groups students will be joining, and which groups you will want coaches to follow.</li>
 	<li><b>Follow up with IT Support and confirm successful completion of test</b>. A green checkmark will appear next to your IT Support professional’s name in the IT Testing portion of the team setup page when the test has been completed and passed.</li>
 	<li>Familiarize yourself with the website. [Site Navigation]{ }</li>
</ul>
<h2>On the Day that Students Launch</h2>
Each classroom teacher who leads students through the process of joining their team and getting started on the path will need to be ready to provide the following information:
<ul>
 	<li><b>Join Code or URL for their group.</b> This can be found on the Group management page. You can find this information by clicking on “Invite Members” next to a specific group.</li>
 	<li><b>Instructions for joining.</b> Students will either go to http://join.eduguide.org and then enter in the group join code, or they will use the join URL. They will be guided through the registration process.</li>
</ul>
There is a handout available in the team library which contains instructions for students to follow as well as a place where coaches can enter their group’s join information. Or, teachers will sometimes share information via either a whiteboard or a webpage that their students can access.

The first activity that students complete contains a survey which is designed to set a baseline for their current level of knowledge and will take a little longer than average to complete.
