<h1># EduGuide Insider</h1>
<h2>## Monitoring your Students’ Progress</h2>
<p></p>
<h2>Note:</h2>
<p></p>
<p>The best tool to turn to after your students have begun working on their path is EduGuide’s Metrics page. From here, you can track students’ progress, review individual students’ comments, and respond directly to students.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In this episode, I’ll review all of the features that you will want to know about as you stay on top of your students’ work on their paths.</p>
<p></p>

<h2>## Navigating to the Metrics</h2>

<h2>Note:</h2>
<p></p>
<p>To view the Metrics page, you will first want to click on the main menu control, then your team’s name, and then “Metrics.” You will be taken to a page which contains a list of the students who belong to the groups that you are currently following.</p>

<h2>Note:</h2>
<p></p>
<p>The Metrics page is made of six main sections. Along the top of the page and on the left side, you will see your avatar and numbers which reflect the number of comments you have posted and the number of cheers you have sent students. On the right hand side, you will see a count of the number of activities that you have completed, and a button labeled “Continue” which will take you back into your path when you click it.</p>
