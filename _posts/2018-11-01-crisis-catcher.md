<p>The Crisis Catcher is a feature which EduGuide uses to detect signs of different signs of behavior or attitudes inside student comments. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intention to do harm to self or others</li>
<li>Fake or nonsense answers</li>
<li>Words repeated in patterns</li>
</ul>
<h2>Screening for nonsense responses</h2>
<p>If a user enters in a string of nonsense instead of a real response, they will be shown a message which encourages them to revise and repost their answer.</p>

<p>When the user sees this message, they can edit their posted comment by clicking on the “Edit” link.</p>

<h2>Screening for Crisis</h2>
<p></p>
<p>The system will react to statements about self harm or suicide with a warning message which reads, ‘Sorry, might have misunderstood, but if you’re feeling down, talking with someone might help. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline has confidential, one-on-one support, 24 hours a day: 1-800-273-8255.”</p>

<h2>Screening and Alerts</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Incidents of suspected thoughts about suicide or self-harm are logged on the site and monitored by EduGuide staff. When a comment is deemed to be a legitimate concern, the student’s coach or coaches will be alerted. The email sent out to coaches prompts them to review the comment and then take action. They also have the option of dismissing the comment.</p>
