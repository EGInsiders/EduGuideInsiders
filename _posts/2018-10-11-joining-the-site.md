There are three ways that a visitor on the site can join:
<ol>
 	<li>Demo Team</li>
 	<li>Join Codes</li>
 	<li>Coach Invitations</li>
</ol>
<h2>Demo Team</h2>
The Demo Team offers interested users a sneak peak of EduGuideâ€™s teams and path feature. When someone joins the Demo Team, they will be able to complete a brief demonstration of the path content. Demo accounts are temporary.
<h2>Join Codes</h2>
Coaches typically share join codes with their students as they are launching their team. Join codes and URLs can be found inside the group management page within the team. As students join the site, they will go to http://join.eduguide.org and then enter in their join code. Or, if they use the join URL, they will be taken to a registration form where the join code has already been entered for them.
<h2>Coach Invitations</h2>
Coach invitations can be sent by admin coaches from the Team Setup page. Invitations are sent via email, and will contain an individualized link which allows the recipient to join the site.
