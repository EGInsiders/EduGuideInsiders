<h1>Launch and Set Up Your Team</h1>
<h2>Registering Your Account</h2>
<p><img src="http://cyberland.gazerbeam.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/null.png" width="544" height="244" alt="" title=""></p>
<p></p>
<p>When your team is ready, a representative from EduGuide will send you, or someone else within your organization who was designated as a contact, an invitation to join the site and begin the configuration process. Coaches who are new to the site will need to register an account, configure the team, request an IT test, and send other coaches invitations asking them to join.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img src="http://cyberland.gazerbeam.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/null-1.png" width="513" height="274" alt="" title=""></p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>Inside the email message, click “Launch Team.”</li>
<li>You will be taken to a page that asks if you already have an account on the site, or if you need to create one. If you need to create a new account, click “No, Join.”</li>
<li>You will be taken to an account registration page where you will be asked to enter your name, email address, password, and title. When you are ready, click “Join.”</li>
</ol>
<h2>Setting Up the Team</h2>
<p><img src="http://cyberland.gazerbeam.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/null-2.png" width="506" height="272" alt="" title=""></p>
<p></p>
<p>After you have joined the site and your team, you will be shown the Team Setup page. This is where you will be configuring your team prior to launching it with students, and where you will return in the future when you need to make other changes. The page contains a list of eight steps that need to be completed in order to prepare the team for its launch with students. You do not need to complete all of the steps in the same day, but it would be good to return here occasionally to check the list and complete additional steps. The Team Setup page is collaborative between Admin Coaches, meaning that other Admin Coaches will be able to make changes to the team setup page and mark steps as done.</p>
<p>During the process of configuring your team, the system will send out progress reports and reminders to Admin Coaches encouraging them to return to the site and complete additional items on the page. You can also track your team’s progress by checking the information displayed at the top of the page. A progress bar will show how many steps are complete.</p>
<h2>Site Testing</h2>
<p><img src="http://cyberland.gazerbeam.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/null-3.png" width="448" height="240" alt="" title=""></p>
<p>Your second step is to send an IT Testing request to your district’s system administrator. When they respond to the request, they will be prompted to complete a brief on-screen wizard, and then run through a short path which approximates the type of content your students will complete once they’ve gotten started in the path.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click inside the “User” field and enter the email address for your building’s network administrator, field technician, or IT contact.</li>
<li>Click “Save.”</li>
<li>A window will appear that asks you to enter a custom message.</li>
<li>When you’re ready, click “Send Invite.”</li>
<li>The window will clear, and the invitation will be sent out.</li>
</ol>
<p>While the invite is pending, the IT Testing section of the setup page will be marked with an orange check mark, indicating that an invitation has been sent out but the testing is incomplete. Once your technical representative has completed the test, the check mark will change to green.</p>
<p><img src="http://cyberland.gazerbeam.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/null-4.png" width="642" height="344" alt="" title=""></p>
<h2>Auto Groups</h2>
<p>The next section of the page will prompt you to adjust your Auto Groups setting. Auto Groups is a feature that will automatically create a new group for lead coaches as they join your team. While an invitation for a lead coach is pending, their email address will display in the group’s title, but after they join the team, the title is updated so it shows their first and last names.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img src="http://cyberland.gazerbeam.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/null-5.png" width="564" height="302" alt="" title=""></p>
<p></p>
<p>Auto Groups is enabled by default, so you can leave this alone if you feel that new groups should be created as your lead coaches. If you have plans to create all custom groups for all of your coaches, for example, then you would want to turn off Auto Groups.</p>
<h2>Invite Team Captain</h2>
<p>Your next step will be to send an invite to your team’s captain.  The Team Captain is the person who guides all of the other coaches on the team toward success. They help other coaches by answering their questions, greeting new coaches on the team, and managing the team library.</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>Click inside the user field. A new field will automatically be created.</li>
<li>Enter your colleague’s email address.</li>
<li>Click “Save.”</li>
<li>In the window that appears, enter an optional custom message and a student start date.</li>
<li>Click “Send Invite.”</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p>An invitation will be sent out asking the staff member to click a link and start an account on your team. As they join, they will automatically be assigned the Admin Coach role.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img src="http://cyberland.gazerbeam.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/null-6.png" width="465" height="249" alt="" title=""></p>
<h2>Invite Coaches</h2>
<p><img src="http://cyberland.gazerbeam.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/null-7.png" width="468" height="250" alt="" title=""></p>
<p></p>
<p>The next step asks you to send invites to the other staff members who will fill the role of Coach on the team. The “Invite Coaches” section of the page shows a list that includes both coaches who have joined the team, and any coaches who have been invited but are still pending. The process for sending invitations to admin, lead, and support coaches is the same as it is for the Team Captain.</p>
<h2>Schedule Launch Event</h2>
<p><img src="http://cyberland.gazerbeam.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/null-7.png" width="416" height="222" alt="" title=""></p>
<p></p>
<p>A launch event helps your staff get on the same page and discuss any important strategies that your team will use once the students get started. EduGuide will provide schools with a presentation and handouts that Team Captains can share with coaches during the launch event.</p>
<p>In this step, enter a date and then send the invitations to your coaches.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click “Add an additional Launch Event.”</li>
<li>Select a date.</li>
<li>Select a time.</li>
<li>Click “Done.”</li>
<li>Click “Save.”</li>
</ol>
<h2>Schedule a Coaching Session</h2>
<p>When your team is ready, you’ll also be able to schedule a training session for your staff. Coaching sessions are led by EduGuide’s Results Coaches, and it is a great time to learn more about the platform and to ask questions.</p>
<h2>Complete the Professional Development Path</h2>
<p>After you complete or skip the sections in the Team Setup page, you will be directed to the Coaches’ orientation activity. The Coaches’ orientation will help to explain the goal of the EduGuide platform and some of the functions of the website.</p>
