<h1>Gibberish and Repetitive Words Detection</h1>
<p>One aspect of the Crisis Catcher involves the detection of repetitive words and gibberish. This would prevent students from “fooling” the system into allowing them to advance through the path system without entering full responses.</p>
<h2>Triggering the Gibberish Detection</h2>
<p>As the user enters their response into the comment field, a message will appear above their comment if it contains nonsensical or repetitive words. The notice will only appear once for each user for every 12 hours, but repeated words will continue to trigger notices in the Crisis Catcher Log.</p>
