User support documents are created in Google Docs, but managed inside Podio workspace. The actual list of documents is stored inside an app within the workspace. This document will help explain how to use the Podio app to locate documents.

## Navigating the Podio Workspace

The workspace consists of a homepage or activity feed and its apps. If you land on the homepage first, you can navigate to the app where the list of documents is stored by clicking on "Knowledgebase" located inside the menu along the top of the page.

## Articles App

There are a number of tools that help you to adjust your view of the list of knowledgebase articles in the "Articles" app.

Inside the Articles app, the fastest way to find the articles that are marked as ready to edit is to click on the views inside the side menu on the left hand side. You can open up this menu by clicking on the arrow located on the left next to the workspace name ("Articles").

Inside the menu, click "Editors" to select the saved view for documents that have been assigned to editors.

You can also use the icons on the right hand side of the screen to adjust how the records are presented.

### Layout

The first icon adjusts the layout of the workspace. When you click on the icon, a menu displaying different choices appears :Badge, Table, Card, Activity, and Calendar. The most useful two layouts are Table or Cards. When the records are displayed in a table, you can get a quick glance at their different values. The Card layout allows you to arrange the records into columns. The other controls allow you to fine tune the views even further.

### Sorting

In the table view, the "A-Z" icon can be used to change the order in which items are listed based on the different fields in each record.

### Options

The screwdriver/wrench icon allows you to adjust specific options for a view. Under the table view, you can use this icon to hide or show specific fields. In the card view, you can choose the value that the columns should represent. Most saved views will use phase and status for the columns.

## Saving your View

If you want to save a custom view, you can do so by clicking "save" inside the left side menu. Before you save, you will need to give your view a name.

## Viewing a Record and Editing a Document

Each record gives you different types of information: document title, phase, status, group, production start date, target publication date, and linked google doc.

The status and the target publication date will give you an idea of the priority level of the document. A preview of the google doc will be displayed into the record, but it is better to edit the google doc inside its own window. You can do this by right clicking on the document's title below the iframe where the preview is shown. This allows you to open up the document inside a separate tab or window, and when youâ€™re done you will be able to return to the record inside Podio.

### Communicating changes or questions

The best place to communicate changes while you are editing the Google document is within the document itself. The changes you mark inside the document will appear as crossouts or suggested text, and will be tagged by a comment along the side. You can also share questions or general suggestions by highlighting a portion of text, and then clicking on the comment button to start a new comment. The project manager is alerted of new comments in the document.

You can also share comments or questions inside the editor's Slack channel. Slack is used for general communication.

### Logging your review

When you are done editing the document, added your name in the "Edited by" field within the document's record. This allows me to quickly identify the documents which have been reviewed.

## Editing Assignment Updates

Knowledgebase articles are usually given one or two weeks for editing before their scheduled publication date. If there are a lot of questions about the articles, they can be pulled from the publication schedule for deeper review and then rescheduled in the future.

## Knowledgebase Article style guide

For the most part, knowledgebase articles are written in a friendly, knowledgeable voice. They run about three or four paragraphs long and will lay out longer processes using numbered or bulleted lists. Screenshots are also used in places where visuals help to clarify how the interface on the site will appear.

Once an article is completed in Google Docs, it is pasted into a new knowledgebase entry on [http://eduguide.freshdesk.com](http://eduguide.freshdesk.com). In this process, most formatting and the images are saved, but other enhancements such as line spacing, tables, and image alignment are lost. So, it is important that the text in the Google docs is kept relatively simple.

The shorter articles will typically fit together to give a longer explanation of how a feature works. So, if an article feels incomplete, keep in mind that there may be other articles which exist or which are planned which will give additional information. But, feel free to get clarification.
