I am anxiously waiting for the moment when our new Path system is deployed to a server where I will be able to begin testing its features. Once that happens, I hope to quickly complete my preliminary review and then bring in volunteer beta testers for additional testing.

Here are some of the new features we've introduced:

* Overall, the activities should load faster

* The ability to choose which activity to complete next

* Poll Steps

* Improvement of the "Comment Response Test."

* Changes to the Path Journal

* Separation of the activities into modules. This information will not be revealed to users, but aspects of it will impact the user experience.

The most helpful type of testing will be to have several testers running through the path activities as either coaches or students, and then reporting bugs and sharing feedback on the functionality. We will also be watching the stability of other features in the path system, such as metrics tools, highlights, path preview, cheers and groups, to make sure that there are no bugs.

Path notifications, in the form of path reminders, comment notifications, and path reports, will also need to be checked for bugs.

## Testing Process

The new path system will be tested on a server that's separate from the live site or our staging site. Chances are good that if you already have an account on the site you will be able to log into this new testing site. But, since itâ€™s temporary, you are welcome to start a brand-new account on that site.

I will let everybody know when we get closer to the point when the path system is ready to test. In the meantime, if you have any questions feel free to contact me at [web@eduguide.org](mailto:web@eduguide.org).
