# Web Development and Beta Testing Update

Things are beginning to heat up in our web development department as we get closer to completing an update to our Path system. I will post more details and a user testing assignment when the feature feels ready. Watch for more information shortly after the Fourth of July.

All we will be asking user testers to do is to complete a series of activities in the path system. A lot of the content will be the same, but with the improvements it will be delivered in different ways. It will be important to have testers interacting with the activities so that I can observe how the system is working.

Beta testers now have access to a private[ forum inside our user support site](http://eduguide.freshdesk.com/support/discussions/3000000297). This will be a place where you can log bugs, feature changes, and questions. I'll also be posting links to user testing assignments here. You are still welcome to post suggestions or questions in Slack, but the forum helps to give the feedback structure and ties it into our development process.

You can also submit feedback from inside our site by using our support widget or launching a live chat. The links are available inside the site's main menu on the right hand side of each page.

The forum will also be a place to read and comment on other user tester's feedback.

If you have any questions or are encountering any issues while getting started with beta testing, feel free to contact me on Slack or email me at [jon@eduguide.org](mailto:jon@eduguide.org).

# Knowledgebase Update

We are just a little more than a month away from the deadline for having the first version of the knowledgebase complete. When completed, the knowledgebase will contain video tutorials, FAQs, and the knowledgebase articles.

I've been working recently on a series of articles which explain how the tools inside the Metrics page work. I’ll be assigning those to editors as soon as they are ready. I am also developing scripts for the video tutorial versions.

For those who are new to Podio, there is a document available in the workspace and in Slack which gives a quick description of how to use the tool and the editorial process. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions.

One great way to help with the development of the knowledgebase is to point out any aspects of our site that may need clarification. Editors are welcome to join the site, try out the features, and then share feedback via the private forum in our support site, or Slack. If you're not a member but want to take a look at the site, just let me know and I’ll set you up.

You are also welcomed to participate in the study of our [user support resources](http://eduguide.freshdesk.com/support/discussions/topics/3000170214).

# Get Connected as a User Tester or Editor

Contact me at [jon@eduguide.org](mailto:jon@eduguide.org) if you would like to participate as either a user tester or editor but are not currently inside our Slack community, and I will get you set up. I can also resolve any issues with accessing the private forum.

I will also be posting updates and links to resources inside a document here. You can [view the information on the web](https://eduguideinsiders.gitbooks.io/eduguideinsiders/content/), or download the [document as a PDF](https://legacy.gitbook.com/download/pdf/book/eduguideinsiders/eduguideinsiders).
