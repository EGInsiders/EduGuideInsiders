I've set up a forum on EduGuide’s support site where members of the beta testing group can post descriptions of any bugs or needed changes that you notice as you are using the site, either as a coach for a team or as a beta tester.

The forum can be [accessed here](http://eduguide.freshdesk.com/support/discussions/3000000297).

If you find that you're unable to access the page, let me know and I’ll make any necessary changes.

This is also a great way to stay in the loop on the issues or changes that other testers are sharing.

You are also welcome to ask questions and share feedback in Slack.
