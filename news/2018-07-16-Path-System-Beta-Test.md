The path system update that our web developers are working on will bring a lot new improvements to the path experience:

* Faster loading speeds, overall

* Introduction of the concept of modules

* New Path Journal which breaks up path activities into modules

* Updated activity completion screen

* Users will sometimes be allowed to choose which activity they work on next

I'll be reaching out to beta testers once enough of the new path system is completed. Register to be a path tester by completing the form linked below:

During testing, beta testers will be welcome to share feedback via Slack, our feedback widget on the site, or via email. Beta testers will also have access to a private forum where they can post feedback and read posts from others.
