Review EduGuide's User Support System

EduGuide uses several strategies to help ensure that the members of its site have a smooth experience. This includes:

* Question marks that users can click for more information

* Tooltips that introduce the interface of pages to new members after they've logged in for the first time

* System messages

* Diagrams

* A link that opens up our user support widget where users can send a question or search our library of support documents

* Reminder notifications

* Live chat.

I'm asking for your feedback on how well you feel these elements work together to help orient users to the site and solve questions or problems.

Here are some of the User Flows or pages where the user support elements tend to be the most critical:

* Logging in or joining the site from the homepage

* Password reset

* Joining the team as an Admin Coach, Lead Coach, and Support coach

* Completing the Team setup page

* Saving your first highlight from the path (all roles)

* Joining the site as a student

* Working on the path

* Reviewing students' progress in the metrics page

* Using the Knowledgebase to answer a question

If you'd like to run through any of these flows but need help just let me know and I can get you started. Our Knowledgebase articles can be viewed inside the widget that appears when you click "Help & Feedback," or in our support site at [http://eduguide.freshdesk.com](http://eduguide.freshdesk.com).

Share your feedback, questions, or thoughts inside the #v_betatesting Slack channel. Or send me email at [web@eduguide.org](mailto:web@eduguide.org).

If you haven't yet, you can [register as a beta tester here](https://www.volunteermatch.org/search/org1019195.jsp):
