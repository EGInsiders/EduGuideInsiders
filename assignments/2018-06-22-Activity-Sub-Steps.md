# Activity Sub Steps

Sub Steps is a new feature in Paths which allows us to present content in activities both horizontally and vertically. Currently, participants in the path always navigate forward or backwards as they are completing a path.

With Sub Steps, content can be built up more gradually within the same step. Information can be provided separately from discussion questions, allowing users to respond in multiple ways to the same material, videos, etc., without having to leave the screen.

Other than appearing on the same screen together, sub steps behave the same as steps. Path participants can respond in a discussion thread. Typically, videos and documents will be displayed in the main body of the step, and then follow up questions or information will be shared via sub steps.

## Path Journal

In the Path Journal, sub steps will appear underneath the main steps and they will be slightly indented. It will be only possible to navigate to a step, but you will be shown all of the sub steps that you viewed when you completed the step.

## Responding to Students

The interface where you respond to path participants' comments in the Metrics page will remain relatively the same. Sub steps will appear under the main steps, and you would respond to comments in the same way. Sub steps will also appear in the list of comments that is shown when you click on "Show all Replies" next to a discussion step.

## Student Experience

The student's experience should stay relatively the same, with the one difference being that content will be shown vertically on the screen.

## Testing Objectives

* General

    * Complete the test path activities either as a coach or a student

* Coaches

    * Reply to one or two students' comments in the metrics page

    * Ask questions about path progress, and then see how well you can answer the questions by looking at the stats in the Metrics page for the team

* Students

    * Complete the activities in the path

    * Try saving a highlight

    * Use the glossary tool to look up definitions or translate different words

    * Log back in to check for coaches' responses to your comments (the staging site wonâ€™t send you notifications). Post replies

    * Try "cheating" the system by skipping questions in sub steps, etc.

    * Edit your previously saved comments.

Post bugs, questions, and general feedback in Slack or submit via our ticketing system. You can open a ticket on the website or send an email to [web@eduguide.org](mailto:web@eduguide.org) and your message will be converted into a ticket.

If you have questions, I can be reached in Slack or by email at [jon@eduguide.org.](mailto:jon@eduguide.org)

### Hardware

This feature is open to testing on different kinds of devices, including mobile devices, tablets, and computers. Please note in your feedback what device you were using when you made your observations. Otherwise, it will be assumed that you were viewing the site on a computer.

## Begin Testing

You can begin testing by joining the testing team on our Staging server site. Click one of the links below to join the team. Everybody will be added as members, but I'll be promoting Coach testers to Coaches once they are on the team.

* [Coaches](https://staging.eduguide.org/join/?invitationCode=1218359)

* [Students](https://staging.eduguide.org/join/?invitationCode=6712573)

When you return the site for additional testing, you will want to go to [http://staging.eduguide.org](http://staging.eduguide.org) and log in with the credentials that you created on the staging server.
