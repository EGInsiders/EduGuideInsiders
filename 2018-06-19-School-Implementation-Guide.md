## School Implementation Guide

EduGuide's program delivers evidence-based, noncognitive training for skills that research indicates can lead to growth across the curriculum in ELA, STEM and other subjects. EduGuide equips students to grow learning mindsets and develop academic strategies that can

* raise achievement (Oyserman, Bybee & Terry 2006).

* narrow gaps (Walton & Cohen 2011).

* increase student persistence and college degree completion (Wilson & Linville 1985).

EduGuide's bite-sized learning model is easy to plug into the classroom. At most schools teachers instruct students to use it about once a week. EduGuide’s self-paced, online activities can be completed in as little as 15 minutes on any desktop or mobile device, or teachers can extend EduGuide for the full class period with blended learning options. Each student works at their own pace through activities which build upon one another to help the students successfully use their newly acquired skills. The most common implementations include

1. **English**. In addition to noncognitive skills, EduGuide is aligned to advance ELA standards by engaging students in reflective writing and critical thinking about informational text and multimedia content. EduGuide has also been designed to support English language learners as they overcome the unique obstacles they face in language learning.

2. **Advisory**. EduGuide helps fulfill the vision of advisory programs by enabling students to build bonds with an advisory coach who helps them grow the skills that will support success in all their classes.

3. **Social Sciences. **By providing opportunities for students to reflect on the  actions and teachings of historical figures, EduGuide helps students develop a sense of purpose about how they want to contribute to their community and their world. EduGuide also introduces key concepts in psychology, and equips students with social-emotional learning and leadership skills that improve communication.

4. **Physical Education.** EduGuide enables students to work on their own personal development plan for their physical health and overall well-being. EduGuide also develops coachability and persistence, behaviorse highly valued in athletics.

5. **After-School Programs. **While implementing EduGuide during the day provides a more consistent experience for most students, the program can also be used in out-of-school time to provide engaging online activities for students that will help them be more successful in school and life.

However it is applied, EduGuide is designed to increase achievement across the curriculum. Staff report seeing improved grades, test scores, academic behaviors and stronger student-teacher bonds. EduGuide can be used in targeted grades and classes or used schoolwide to grow a positive climate and build a college and career-ready culture. We look forward to partnering with you.

## Implementation Level Options

EduGuide's program can be adjusted to the time you have available. You can get started where you’re at and add more time to add more impact. You can decide as a group what level to implement or you can leave the choice to your team members. Below are a few options.

* Students given regular time to do the evidence-based online training.

    * Student Time: 15+ Minutes

    * Staff Time: 0

* Coached. Each week staff take at least 15 minutes to reply to as many students as they can. Students and staff report that coaching builds stronger bonds and encourages students to get more out of the training activities. More comprehensive coaching averages 1 minute per person and is often higher in the first weeks. You can also increase coaching by adding additional staff or volunteers as group mentors.

    * Student Time: 15+

    * Staff Time: 15+

* Coached + PD. Staff and mentors can do a 15-minute, self-paced, professional development version of the activities with tips on how to coach students in building their skills. EduGuide PD strengthens program impact, increases staff effectiveness and builds a more consistent climate & culture.

    * Student Time: 15+

    * Staff Time: 30+
